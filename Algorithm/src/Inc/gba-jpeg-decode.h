/** @module gba-image_jpeg.h
 *
 *  A JPEG decompressor, targeted for the GameBoy Advance (although there
 * should be no machine-specific aspects if you disable JPEG_USE_IWRAM
 * and JPEG_MARK_TIME).  On the GBA it consumes, all with slight potential
 * variance:
 *
 * 3348 bytes of IWRAM, temporary
 * 7756 bytes of ROM
 * 4720 bytes of stack space, usually in IWRAM
 * 350 milliseconds for decompressing a representative image
 *
 * Unlike before when IWRAM was permanently used, it's now loaded in just
 * before decompression, allowing you to spend IWRAM on more tools called
 * constantly rather than one you call only once in awhile.  There is no
 * permanent IWRAM usage with this library.
 *
 * It has a low capacitance for unusual JPEGs.  They cannot be progressive,
 * use arithmetic coding, have more than 4 components in a scan, and must be
 * 8-bit.  They can be colour or grayscale, and any component scaling factors
 * are valid (unless if JPEG_HANDLE_ANY_FACTORS is reset, in which case only
 * 2:1:1 is allowed).  The maximum component scale factors cannot be three.  In
 * general, you'll be all right, but if it doesn't like your input it will not
 * react sensibly in embedded.
 *
 * This code is in the public domain.  JPEG is used for both its standard
 * meaning and for JFIF.
 *
 * Revision 1: Inflicted stricter warnings, fixed C99-using code, and reduced
 *     allocation footprint (6144 bytes less).
 * Revision 2: Reduced ROM usage by 276 bytes, with the body going to 832 bytes
 *     of IWRAM.  I made it more configurable, particularly in YCbCr->RGB
 *     conversion.  Some brute force ROM usage reduction.
 * Revision 3: Removed all memset, malloc, and free dependencies.  This
 *     increases stack use drastically but also makes it completely
 *     self-sufficient.
 * Revision 4: Saved 6176 bytes of JPEG_Decoder state by exploiting an
 *     allowance of baseline JPEG decoding.  This requires 3088 more bytes of
 *     stack space, however.
 * Revision 5: Made the fixed-point shift configurable.  Can now be compiled
 *     with -ansi -pedantic, and fixed stack usage so that it is always
 *     predictable by exploiting a JPEG restriction.
 * Revision 6: A fixed type has been added and is configurable.  16-bit
 *     fixed is valid if you reduce JPEG_FIXSHIFT to 4 or lower.
 * Revision 7: Inserted assertions for when you're not on the embedded
 *     environment; good for confirming that a given file is compatible with
 *     the decompressor.  "this" is no longer used as a variable name.  Added
 *     necessary fluff for dealing with C++.
